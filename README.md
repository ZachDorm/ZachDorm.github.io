# Zach Dorminey
My name is Zach Dorminey. I am a Master's student in Geography at the Department of Geography and Sustainability at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://utk.edu). I am focusing on quantitative methods in geographical information systems (GIS).

## Background
I am from Morgantown, West Virginia where I grew up and went to college at West Virginia University. I graduated from WVU with a BS in Civil Engineering and worked for about 2 years in the industry. After exploring some opportunities in geography, I decided to go back to school and pursue in-depth geographical methods.

## Teaching
In my time at UTK I have worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, serving as a TA for GEOG 131 and GEOG 132.

## Research
My research interests include small area estimation, cluster analysis methods, and quantitative methods as a larger body of study. All my work points to my fascination with different methods to account for spatially related phenomena. I enjoy reading the original works foundational to quantitative methods in geography and learning how those works are vital to cutting edge research today.

My most recent work, Assessing the Spatial Clustering of Right of Way Permits in Davidson County, Tennessee, utilizes Ripley's K function to compare the clustering tendencies of right of way permits to the distribution of addresses. I developed an R Shiny app in this work so that my methods are easily visualized and repeated with different datasets without the need for the user to have experience with GIS. I will presenting a poster on this work at GeoSym 2023 at UTK and at AAG 2023 in Denver.
